This is the web application I designed and developed for my thesis project "My Heels Are Better Than yours". 
The thesis project is about to design and developed a in-shoe system for minimizing the discomfort of wearing fashion high heels. 
The web application is designed to recieve analyzed results and messages from a host web application, which analyze data from a 3d printed shoe with particle photon (wifi module)

This application is designed and developed in Django.
